Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **BYTE (Bringing Your Tech Experience) Club at CCNY**! BYTE is a student-run club dedicated to helping students build impressive projects, expand their technical skills, and enhance their resumes.

## About Us

At BYTE, we aim to empower students by providing them with the tools, guidance, and community to turn their ideas into fully developed applications. We focus on collaborative learning, where students work together to tackle real-world problems, develop apps, and showcase their work in a Demo Night at the end of each semester.

## What We Do

- **Project Development**: Students wil be divided into team of 4 to work on projects that push their technical boundaries. 

- **Demo Night**: A showcase event at the end of each semester where students present their projects to a live audience of peers and industry professionals.
  
## How to Get Involved

We welcome students of all skill levels to join us! Whether you're just starting or have been coding for years, BYTE is a space to grow, learn, and contribute. Keep an eye out for our events and project opportunities throughout the semester.
