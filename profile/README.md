Welcome to the official GitHub org for **BYTE (Build Your Technical Experience) Club under ACM at CCNY**! 
BYTE is a student-run club dedicated to helping students build impressive projects, expand their technical skills, and enhance their resumes.

## About Us

At BYTE, we aim to empower students by providing them with the tools, guidance, and community to turn their ideas into fully developed applications. Our goal is to provide students with a learning opportunity that they can talk about during technical interviews and build their confidence in building applications. We focus on collaborative learning, where students work together to tackle real-world problems, develop apps, and showcase their work in a Demo Night at the end of each semester.

## What We Do

- **Project Development**: Students work in teams of 4 to collaborate on projects 
- **Demo Night**: A showcase event at the end of each semester where students present their projects to a live audience of peers and professors
  
## How to Get Involved
We welcome students who demonstrate a passion for coding and are committed to learning more about software development. Applications for the Spring 2025 Cohort will be open in the winter break!

## Contribute
