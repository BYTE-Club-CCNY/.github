# BYTE Club (Build. Your. Technical. Experience.) 

![BYTE Logo](../img/Primary%20Logo.png)

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **BYTE (Bringing Your Tech Experience) Club at CCNY**! BYTE is a student-run club dedicated to helping students build impressive projects, expand their technical skills, and enhance their resumes.

## About Us

At BYTE, we aim to empower students by providing them with the tools, guidance, and community to turn their ideas into fully developed applications. We focus on collaborative learning, where students work together to tackle real-world problems, develop apps, and showcase their work in a Demo Night at the end of each semester.

## What We Do

- **Project Development**: Students will be divided into team of 4 to work on projects that push their technical boundaries. 
- **Mid Semester Catch up**: Halfway through the semester, we will hold a convention for our cohort to see the progress of other teams and meet other accepted cohort.
- **Demo Night**: A showcase event at the end of each semester where students present their projects to a live audience of peers and industry professionals.
  
## How to Get Involved

We welcome students who demonstrate a passion for coding and are committed to learning more about software development. Applications for the Fall 2024 Cohort are live! [Apply today!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK8xf-lyFWMm4BcrrwNYlRb0mCMfye_oKbfJgYZVkvQY5SJg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
